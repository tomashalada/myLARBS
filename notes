TODO:
- Make unified bar script for i3block and dwmblocks
(atm i3block has all its tools in i3blocsk directory)

- In .local/bin/old are same old scripts, this needs clean a bit

- nvim coc settings is a bit mess

DONE:
- Function for additional programs added to larbs.sh
  (currently installs node for coc nvim)
  
- I use both, dwm as well as i3, so i3 and i3block are part of the repos

- pip packages added to progs.csv
